### VisionAI Mobile Frontend

A simple mobile app serving as the frontend for an API created by a friend ([Carlos Santos](https://github.com/capssantos)) â€” [https://apivision.carlosp.dev/](https://apivision.carlosp.dev/).

The app captures images every second, sends them to the API for analysis via AI, and uses natural voice synthesis to describe what is seen in the images.

#### Tools Used

- **Expo**: Mobile development framework
- **React Native**: For building the app's user interface
